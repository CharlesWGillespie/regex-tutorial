# My Matching Hex Value Regex Tutorial

Hello there! Today, we're rolling up our sleeves to explore the intricacies of hex color codes. Those six or three characters after a '#' might seem straightforward, but let's dissect them and build a regex that stands up to the challenge.

# Breaking Down Matching Hex Value

Our regex for matching hex color values will be the centerpiece of our discussion:

` ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$`

As we dissect this regex, we'll touch on each of the elements mentioned below, providing practical examples along the way.

- [Anchors](#anchors)
- [Quantifiers](#quantifiers)
- [OR Operator](#or-operator)
- [Character Classes](#character-classes)
- [Flags](#flags)
- [Grouping and Capturing](#grouping-and-capturing)
- [Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions)
- [Greedy and Lazy Match](#greedy-and-lazy-match)
- [Boundaries](#boundaries)
- [Back-references](#back-references)
- [Look-ahead and Look-behind](#look-ahead-and-look-behind)

### Anchors

In Regex, an anchor is a metacharacter that represents a specific position within the text. Anchors are used to assert where a pattern should occur in relation to the start or end of a line or word.

In the regex pattern `^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$`, the `^` and `$` symbols are anchors.

`^`: This anchor asserts the position at the beginning of the line and where the pattern should start. 

`$`: This anchor asserts the position at the end of the line and where the pattern should end

So, combined, these anchors `^` and `$` ensure that the entire line should match the specified pattern, ensuring that it starts with an optional # symbol followed by either six or three characters from the set `a-f0-9`. 

### Quantifiers
 Quantifiers specify the quantity of characters or sets to match in a pattern. It essentially allows you to define how many times a specific element should appear in the text

There is one quantifier being used here:

Curly Braces: `{6}`and `{3}` are being used to specify that the preceding character class `[a-f0-9]` should be repeated exactly 6 times or 3 times.

### OR Operator

In regular expressions, the OR operator is represented by the vertical bar `|`. It allows you to specify multiple alternatives within a pattern. The OR operator functions as a logical "OR," meaning that the pattern will match if either of the alternatives is found in the text. 

Let's break down the relevant part of the pattern:
`([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})`

1. `[a-f0-9]{6}`: This part matches exactly six alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-f).
2. `|`: The vertical bar serves as the OR operator, indicating an alternative option.
3. `[a-f0-9]{3}`: This part matches exactly three alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-f).

Just like in hex code you can input 6 characters or 3 characvters and you will still get a color!
